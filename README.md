Welcome everyone,
This website will probably eat your ram but it's cool anyways, fair price for awesome stuff.

I've used Three.js library for the Shirt 3D model, nothing hardcore.
You can change the Color of the shirt, you can upload a logo you can even upload a pattern and toogle on/off each of them, just have fun with it nothing will be stored.

There is the AI option, in which I've linked DALL-E api to respond depending on the prompts that can be pushed in the form.(be on it or get your own and have more fun).
